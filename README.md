User Registration System:
This project implements a simple User Registration System using HTML, CSS, Core Java, JDBC, and Servlets. The registration form allows users to enter their details, which are then stored in a database. The project demonstrates how to connect a frontend form to a backend database using JDBC.

Features: User Registration Form: A user-friendly form to collect user information such as name, email, and password. Backend Processing: Form data is sent to a Java Servlet which processes and stores the data in a relational database using JDBC. Database Integration: The data is inserted into the database for persistence. Frontend Design: The form is designed using HTML and CSS for an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interface. Error Handling: Basic validation for the registration form and error handling in the backend.

Technologies Used Frontend: HTML CSS, Backend: Java (Core Java) Servlets JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), Database: MySQL (or any relational database like PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), Server: Apache Tomcat (or any servlet container).
